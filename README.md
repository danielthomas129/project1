#### Installation
---
To successfully install this project you need to do the following:

1. Create a account at Spoonacular API and Email.js API.
1. Start making the html page, which should include our four main html elements: search area, tabs with content, DOM area below tabs, and modals with DOM areas.
1. In javascript write code to perform the AJAX calls to get the information needed to display the recipe and related information into the DOM area.  We decided to display 10 recipes per call.
1. Develop the functions to make your buttons for allergens, diets, and cuisines functional and add to the url you send into the API.
1. In the modal areas display the recipe and ingredient information when the approriate button is clicked, show recipe and show ingredients, respectively.
1. Lastly, make a clear button to reset the DOM elements and all variables back to base state, so the user can re-search for another recipe(s).
